 <h1 class="color-2">BIG DREAM </h1>
 <h4> my dream is to be <span class="color-2"> #1 programmer </span> over the world  </h4>
 <p>  My passion for programming started from a young age, as my computer was my only friend. I was always fond of what happens behind the scenes, how does this device work, how do programs and applications work? Who are the ones who make them?  Is it magic? I also want to be a magician .... I started modifying others' Projects like Games to unlock more stages, cars or characters, then the matter evolved into the hacker experience through the termex. My ambition has grown now and I want to make my own magic </p>
<p> Until now , I've learned a few things like  </p>
 
 <ol>  
 <li> PAYTHON </li>
 <li> HTML5 </li>
 <li>  CSS3 </li>
 <li> JAVASCRIPT </li>
 </ol>
